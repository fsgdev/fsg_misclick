# Description
Simple script I made back in March 2025 when I was just getting back into FiveM, allows you to do /mc whenever you accidentally hit somebody in order to give them their health back. This is especially good for servers that make sure to value player's health, and increased immersion with situations like these. This can prevent unneccesary conflicts.
